# Hi there, I'm Arun Karoth üëã

I'm a Lead Site Reliability Engineer and Platform Architect with over a decade of experience building and scaling resilient, automated infrastructure for highly regulated environments in the finance and government technology sectors.

My passion lies at the intersection of infrastructure reliability and intelligent automation. I believe the next generation of platform engineering will be driven by AI, and my goal is to be at the forefront of building those self-healing, observable, and efficient systems.

### üî≠ What I'm Currently Focused On

I'm currently on a dedicated journey to merge my deep expertise in SRE with the power of modern AI. My focus is on mastering the practical application of AI in infrastructure operations, including:

* Building **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems to create "intelligent" documentation that can answer questions about our complex infrastructure.
* Developing **AI Agents** (using frameworks like LangChain/CrewAI) that can automate incident response, from diagnosis to remediation.
* Designing **AI-native CI/CD workflows** that replace traditional scripting with goal-oriented, intelligent automation.
* Deepening my skills in **Python** and **Golang** for building custom AI-powered SRE tooling.
